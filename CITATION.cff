  The omero_slurm_client Python package is a library that
  facilitates working with a Slurm cluster in the context of
  the Omero platform.


  The package includes the SlurmClient class, which extends
  the Fabric libraryâ€™s Connection class to provide SSH-based
  connectivity and interaction with a Slurm cluster. The
  package enables users to submit jobs, monitor job status,
  retrieve job output, and perform other Slurm-related
  tasks.


  Additionally, the package offers functionality for
  configuring and managing paths to Slurm data and
  Singularity images, as well as specific image models and
  their associated repositories.


  Overall, the omero_slurm_client package simplifies the
  integration of Slurm functionality within the Omero
  platform and provides an efficient workflow for working
  with Slurm clusters.
