abstract: >-
  In the rapidly evolving field of bioimaging, the
  integration and orchestration of Findable, Accessible,
  Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) image analysis
  workflows remains a challenge. We introduce BIOMERO, a
  bridge connecting OMERO, a renowned bioimaging data
  management platform, FAIR workflows and high-performance
  computing (HPC) environments. BIOMERO, featuring our
  opensource Python library "OMERO Slurm Client",
  facilitates seamless execution of FAIR workflows,
  particularly for large datasets from High Content or High
  Throughput Screening. BIOMERO empowers researchers by
  eliminating the need for specialized knowledge, enabling
  scalable image processing directly from OMERO. BIOMERO
  notably supports the sharing and utilization of FAIR
  workflows between OMERO, Cytomine/BIAFLOWS, and other
  bioimaging communities. BIOMERO will promote the
  widespread adoption of FAIR workflows, emphasizing
  reusability, across the realm of bioimaging research. Its
  user-friendly interface will empower users, including
  those without technical expertise, to seamlessly apply
  these workflows to their datasets, democratizing the
  utilization of AI by the broader research community.
