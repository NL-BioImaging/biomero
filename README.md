# omero_slurm_client
The Omero-Slurm Python package is a library that facilitates working with a Slurm cluster in the context of the Omero platform. The package includes the SlurmClient class, which extends the Fabric library's Connection class to provide SSH-based connectivity and interaction with a Slurm cluster. The package enables users to submit jobs, monitor job status, retrieve job output, and perform other Slurm-related tasks. Additionally, the package offers functionality for configuring and managing paths to Slurm data and Singularity images, as well as specific image models and their associated repositories. Overall, the Omero-Slurm package simplifies the integration of Slurm functionality within the Omero platform and provides an efficient workflow for working with Slurm clusters.
# SlurmClient
The SlurmClient class is a Python class that extends the Connection class from the Fabric library. It allows connecting to and interacting with a Slurm cluster over SSH. 

It includes attributes for specifying paths to directories for Slurm data and Singularity images, as well as specific paths, repositories, and Dockerhub information for different Singularity image models. The class provides methods for running commands on the remote Slurm host, submitting jobs, checking job status, retrieving job output, and tailing log files. It also offers a from_config class method to create a SlurmClient object by reading configuration parameters from a file. Overall, the class provides a convenient way to work with Slurm clusters and manage job execution and monitoring.
